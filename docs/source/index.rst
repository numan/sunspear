Welcome to Sunspear's documentation!
====================================

Sunspear in a library for storing activity streams. It is an implementation of the 
`JSON Activity Stream 1.0 <http://activitystrea.ms/specs/json/1.0/>`_ specification.
Currently, Sunspear only supports ``Riak`` as a storage backend, however, it is modular
enough to allow the use of custom backend.
